# ⚙️ CompliCode

> _"See your code’s complexity before it sees production."_

**CompliCode** is a next-generation **IDE** that helps developers write cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code by **visualizing complexity as you type**.  
  CompliCode turns code quality into something you can *see*.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Write code** — just like in any IDE.
